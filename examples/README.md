# OGB Examples

We provide baseline experiments/example scripts for **[node property prediction tasks](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/tree/master/examples/nodepropred)**, **[link property prediction tasks](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/tree/master/examples/linkpropred)** and **[graph property prediction tasks](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/tree/master/examples/graphpropred)** on *all* datasets currently included in OGB.

Each dataset is hosted in its own folder and provides separate examples for each individual model.
Please read their respective `README.md` files for further information on how to run them.
