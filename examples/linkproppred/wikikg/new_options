New options in the python run.py -

--dump_all, --test_dump_hist, --test_dump_byrel
	Dump histograms of scores, either 1d or 2d (distinguished by relation)

--dump_sample
	Dump a full scoring entry from each batch

--print_relation_embedding
--print_relation_option
	various relation prints: list, triple_add

--evaluator mrr2
	print a line for every test with rank, top score, etc.

--test_random_sample
	set size of negative (or other) random sample in testing

--do_check
	go through entire dataset (train/valid/test) once.
	actually this is combo of do_test, do_valid and evaluate_train.

--test_change_model
	allow using different model (with same parameters) from training
	need to use this to change most parameters, e.g. batch size

--test_training
	treat full training set like a testing set, for statistics

Models:
	BasE = standard norm distance
	Aligned = cos similarity of relation vector and tail-head
	Aligned1 = ||h-t+r||-||h-t||
	AlignedP = ||h.r|| or ||t.r||

To check:

- triples of relations => rules.
